          On February 15, 2025, the Talidhay team successfully launched their
          community event, Art From the Heart, at Barangay Amihan. The event was
          designed to create a space for young children to express themselves
          through art, and it became a lively gathering filled with creativity
          and joy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Present during the event were core organizers: Julia Marie Ladrera
          (President), Tania Virgino (Vice President), Marylyne Vargas
          (Secretary), Angel Macabale (Treasurer), Abigail Macabale (VCCC),
          Cyril Lagdameo (MDC), Mark Benlot (FWC), Joshua Ladion (FWC), Aya
          Africano (MDC), and Markus Bernales (volunteer). Despite the initial
          plan to begin at 2:00 PM, the event officially started at 2:30 PM and
          ran until 5:00 PM.
          <br />
          <br />
          The activity welcomed an initial set of 50 kids aged 9 and below. By
          the end of the program, 45 children participated fully, engaging with
          the art materials and enjoying the atmosphere curated by the team.
          Each element of the event followed a smooth program flow—from
          welcoming the kids and guiding them to their tables, to providing
          instructions, and encouraging them throughout the session.
          <br />
          <br />
          The team’s collective efforts were visible in every corner: from
          colorful decorations to thoughtful logistics like seating
          arrangements, program hosting, and facilitation of materials. Roles
          were distributed effectively, with documentation handled by Cyril and
          Aya, games and energizers coordinated by Joshua, Julia, and Markus,
          registration managed by Mark and Abi, and ushering done by Jeng and
          Len. Tania also delivered a warm announcement to the community,
          setting the tone for a fun and meaningful afternoon.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout the event, the organizers upheld the values of
          responsibility and care—reminding each other to model respectful
          behavior around the kids, including a strict no-vaping and
          no-profanity policy. Safety protocols were reinforced, including
          immediate coordination with the barangay in case of any incidents.
          <br />
          <br />
          As the event concluded, the Talidhay team was filled with a sense of
          accomplishment. The smiles and laughter of the children, along with
          their colorful artwork, stood as vibrant reminders of the impact of
          community-driven initiatives. “Art From the Heart” ended not just as
          an event but as a heartfelt celebration of creativity, connection, and
          service.
